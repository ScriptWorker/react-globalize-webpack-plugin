README to be defined.

For now, please read [Globalize Webpack Plugin][] documentation. Usage is very
similar, but with the following attributes:

* `extractDefaultMessages`: writes new default messages to the file specified
  under the `messages` filepath specified.
* `extractAllMessages`: writes new default messages for all supported locales
  under the `messages` filepath specified.

Both attributes require `messages` to be set.

Also, see [react-globalize][] and [Globalize][].
